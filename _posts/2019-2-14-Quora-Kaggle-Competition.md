In the past month, I took a dive into a Kaggle competition: Quora Insincere Questions Classification. This was an important problem for Quora because they want to remove toxic and divisive content while keeping their platform a place safe for unique and sometimes opposing insights.

It was an impressively large labeled text data set, with over 1.3 million samples. The only feature given was the sequence of text, so natural language processing and recurrent neural networks were the tools of choice to tackle this problem. 

I gave a talk sharing some of the things I learned from this competition and Kaggle in general. Here are the slides!

The private leader board also came out today. Congratulations to the winners, The Zoo!
