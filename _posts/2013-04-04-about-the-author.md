Hi there! I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Below is a compilation of some of my favourite things that I have built over the years. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for more information on my other projects, as well as some of my writing.
